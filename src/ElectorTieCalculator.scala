/**
 * Using a modified knapsack algorithm, prints out the most likely states to cause a tie. States printed out are assumed
 * to have gone to the Democrats all other states are assumed to have gone to the Republicans.
 *
 * Nate Silver did an interesting write up about this possibility here:
 * http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/new-polls-raise-chance-of-electoral-college-tie/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0
 *
 * It is interesting to compare these results to Nate's. They are subtly different than what he came up with
